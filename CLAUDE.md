# Rust Cloud Backup Tool - Learning Project

## Current learning progress
- Right now we're starting from scratch

## Learning Goals
- I'm learning Rust coming from Python/Ruby/Go
- I want to understand WHY not just WHAT when getting help
- Prefer idiomatic Rust patterns over quick solutions
- I should write the code, but you can guide me through it or once
  we've covered a patter, you can finish boilerplate-like code for me

## When Working With Me
- Explain Rust concepts when introducing them (ownership, lifetimes, Result types, etc.)
- Point out when I'm fighting the borrow checker and why
- Suggest idiomatic alternatives when my code looks too "Go-like"
- We will collaborate on the plan, and then ask me if I want you to
  implement it or guide me through implementing it

## Development Standards
- We will add development standards here as I learn them - for example
  how to maintain code formatting, static checkers (for example in
  python we would run `ruff fmt` or `ruff check`)
